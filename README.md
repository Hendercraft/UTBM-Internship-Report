This repository is a template for internship reports at the UTBM. It is based on the [UTBM internship LaTeX version](https://github.com/pinam45/utbm-latex-internship-report-covers) and has been adapted and expanded with multiple functionalities.

## I. Support

This template can be used in several places:

- On [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)
- On Windows with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- On Linux/MacOS (untested but should work on VSCode)

## II. Usage & Requirements

> **Warning**  
> This template is free to use, but the covers belongs to the [UTBM](https://www.utbm.fr/) and can only be used with their authorization.

> **Note**  
> UTBM and all UTBM-related trademarks and logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of the [University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr/) in France, other countries, or both.

### On Visual Studio Code

This template **require** the use of the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension to compile the $LaTeX$ files directly within VS Code.

While they are not required to use the template, the following extensions are recommended for some Quality of Life improvements:

- 🔸 [LaTeX Utilities](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tecosaur.latex-utilities) - Useful extension to extends capabilities of LaTeX Workshop.
- 🪄 [LaTeX Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nickfode.latex-formatter) - Appreciate a more user friendly code base.
- 🔦 [LaTeX language support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=torn4dom4n.latex-support) - This extension adds syntax highlighting for LaTeX files.
- 📗 [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - Don't let typos slip through the cracks.

To compile the report, you can use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> shortcut or the `LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project` command inside Visual Studio Code.

### UTBM's Covers

You can find all configurable options of UTBM covers within the below code, but if you feel unhappy you can still edit the covers [with this file here](https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report/blob/main/libs/utbmcovers.sty).  
<!-- Code block mention (GitHub markdown feature) -->
https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report/blob/108d23dee1516941a37bd0aa2fcbf109c8e18f6c/main.tex#L32-L55  

You can also modify colors using those variables:  
https://github.com/Juknum/UTBM-Internship-Report/blob/108d23dee1516941a37bd0aa2fcbf109c8e18f6c/libs/utbmcovers.sty#L36-L55  

Finally you can call both covers using:

```tex
\makeutbmfrontcover{} % Front cover
\makeutbmbackcover{}  % & Back cover
```

Covers support english and french languages, you can change the language using the `babel` package:

```tex
\usepackage[english]{babel} % English
\usepackage[french]{babel}  % French
```

## III. Installation

While this template gives you the possibility to use it on Overleaf, if you want to use it on your computer, you will need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

There is multiple way to install it on your computer:

> **Note**  
> More information on the LaTex Workshop extension can be found [here](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install).

### 🍃 Overleaf

This template can be used on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/):

1. the easiest way to use it is to zip the whole repository (unless you are not on a free plan) and upload it while creating a new project: <p align=center><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49886317/197605315-66d5d380-40dd-475a-9455-e071f773e242.png"></p>

2. The only last step is to change the compiler to `XeLaTeX`, you can do it by clicking on the `Menu` button and then you can find it in the `Settings` category.

### 🪟 Windows

#### [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download)  

Easy to install but does not ship with Perl. If you choose MiKTeX, you have to install Perl by yourself (explained below), which the `latexmk` package requires. Without Perl, `latexmk` fails with errors.

1. You can install Perl using Strawberry Perl, which is available [here](http://strawberryperl.com/). Once it is installed, you can verify that Perl is available by opening a command prompt and typing `perl -v`. If it is installed correctly, you should see the version of Perl that you installed.

2. Verify that both Perl (this should be good if the `perl -v` command succeeded) and MiKTeX are in your `PATH`. Then if VSCode was open while you were installing them, you need to restart it.

3. After restarting VS Code, you should be able to compile your $LaTeX$ files using the LaTeX Workshop extension!

### 🖥️ Linux / MacOS

> _I did not have the time to test it on Linux nor MacOS but any PR that would add support for these OSes would be greatly appreciated._
